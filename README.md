# Hello, I'm Eli

**Systems Software Engineer** with production experience in **Rust**. I specialize in open-source leadership, scaling geospatial platforms, and designing custom RISC architectures.

### My Projects

**[Until Every Cage is Empty](https://github.com/counterspecies/UntilEveryCage)**
*Lead Software Engineer & Maintainer*
A full-stack, open-source geospatial platform for animal rights.
* **Scale:** Serves over **54,000 documented facilities** to **3,000+ monthly users** (activists, journalists, and researchers).
* **Tech:** High-performance RESTful API in **Rust (Axum)**, Python ETL pipelines, and Leaflet.js.
* **Impact:** Secured a seed grant from the Pollination Project and crowdfunded global support.

**[Fish Defender Mapping Tool](https://github.com/eliperez-dev)**
*Contract Software Engineer*
* **Overview:** A serverless mapping application to visualize fish-friendly dive locations.
* **Tech:** End-to-end engineered using **Cloudflare Workers** (serverless backend) and Google Sheets API integration.

**[RISC-V Inspired CPU & Toolchain](https://github.com/eliperez-dev/electron)**
* **Core:** Designed a **4-stage pipelined, 8-bit CPU** from first principles in a pure logic-gate environment.
* **Toolchain:** Developed a custom assembler, emulator, and VS Code extension from scratch in **Rust** for a novel Turing-complete ISA.

**[Full-Stack IoT Telemetry Platform](https://github.com/eliperez-dev/Portable-Weather-Station)**
* **Embedded:** Authored a bare-metal sensor driver in **Embedded Rust (no_std)** for the ESP32.
* **Backend:** Engineered a Python Flask API with **SQLite** to ingest high-frequency real-time data.
